#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering princiles to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications, with the aim of creating reliable, efficient and scalable solutions



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

They are:

1. the emergence of structured programming in the 1970s
This approach emphasized modularity, readability and maintainability by breaking down complex problems into smaller ,simpler manageable ones. it made use of languages such as Pasca and Modula-2

2. the rise of object oriented programming in the 1980s
This facilitated organization of codes into reusable objects.Its principles like encapsulation, inheritance  and polymorphism made it possible to  create more flexible and maintainable software. Also, it emplyed languages like Smalltalk and C++.

3. the adoption of agile methodologies and DevOps in the 1990s
These emhasized iterative development, collaboration and continuous delivery. Also, the use of agile approaches like Srum and Kanban made it possible for software development teams to adapt to changing requirements and deliver value faster.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.Besides, DevOps practices 
focus on automating the software development lifecycle ,improved efficiency,and collaboration between development and operatios teams

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

The role of a software developer in a software engineering team is to write ,test and maintain code in order to build and improve software applications.

The role of a Quality Assurance Engineer is to ensure that software products meet high quality standards before being released for public consumption.

A project manager 's role is to plan and execute projects and to ensure their completion within time, within budget, and withon scope. He also manages resources and stakeholders.

Discuss the imporentance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) are important to software developers as they streamline the coding  process , enhancing productivity, improving code quality , by combining all the necessary tools for coding like editors, compilers, debuggers, all in a single user-friendly interface.
Examples are: Visual Studio and Pycharm.
Version control systems are important in tracking changes in files and codes over time, enabling collaboration, ensuring accountability,and facilitating efficient project management and development.
Examples are: Git and Mercurial 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common challenges faced by software engineers are:
a) tight deadlines
b) complex coding problems
c) maintaining code quality 
d) keeping up with technology 
e) managing communication with stakeholders.

Solutions to challenges faced by software engineers include:
a) continuous learning 
b) adopting agile methodologies
c) strong communication
d) robust testing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: This is a way of testing the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a software application.It is important in early debugging and improvement in code quality.


Integration testing: This is a type of testware testing in which the different units , modules, or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity. It helps to resolve compatibility or communication issues and improves code quality.

System testing: This examines every component of an application to make sure that they work as a complete and unified whole. It prevents potential compatibility issues and improves software products

Acceptance testing: This is a crucial quality assurance process where end-users or clients verify that a software application meets specified business requirements snd user needs before deployment, ensuring functionality, usability and readiness for production.It ensures that software meets user needs and business requirements and ensures reliability of doftware products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering: This is the practice of carefully crafting instructions (prompts) to guide generative AI models, like large language models (LLMs), towards producing desired outputs, improving their accuracy, relevance, and overall quality.


Prompt engineering is important in interacting with AI models as it allows users to guide AI models towards desired outputs by crafting clear and specific instructions, ultimately leading to more accurate, relevant,and useful results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt: " Just give me some information about  school enrollment in Nigeria"

Improved version of the vague prompt: " Give me statistics on primary school enrollment from 1990 to 2000 in Nigeria"

The improved version is more effective because the AI will be able to supply specifically what is requested rather than a combination of confusing statistics.![1000096998](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cf236cc-fe37-4cc3-a783-31576a7f90c0)
